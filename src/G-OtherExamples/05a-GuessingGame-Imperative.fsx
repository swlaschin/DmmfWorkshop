// =================================
// Guessing game- Imperative implementation
//
// How the game works:
// * Think of a number between 1..100
// * The computer guesses a number (e.g. 50) and asks
//   "is your number bigger than the guess"
// * You say: yes or no
// * The computer guesses again,
//   or if it knows, tells you your number
// =================================

(*
Implementation details:

1. Ask "Think of a number between 1 and 100"
2. Set the bounds for a new game to 1..100
3. Given the bounds, make a guess
   (or if you know the answer go to step 7)
4. Show the guess with the text "Is your number bigger than %i? [y,n,q]"
5. Accept input
6a. If the input is "y" or "n" then
       update the bounds and go to step 3
6b. If the input is "q" then
       show "Game over. Thanks for playing" and quit
6c. If the input is something else then
       show "Please enter [y,n,q]" and go to step 5
----
7. (jump from 3) If you know the answer, show "Your number is %i"
8. Show "Do you want to play again or quit? [y,q]"
9. Accept input
10a. If the input is "y"  then
   go to step 1
10b. If the input is "q" then
   show "Game over. Thanks for playing" and quit
10c. If the input is something else then
   show "Please enter [y,q]" and go to step 9
