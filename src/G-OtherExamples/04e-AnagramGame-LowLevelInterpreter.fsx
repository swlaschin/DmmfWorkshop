// =================================
// Anagram game - Low Level Interpreter implementation
// =================================


(*
This is the Interpreter implementation
* The "Pure.play" function returns a "program" with instructions for the shell I/O
* The top level shell interprets those instructions by reading or writing
  However it could be interpreted in another way, e.g. with a GUI
* In this implementation, the instructions are "low level"
  such as ReadLine, WriteLine, etc.
  The exact text to display is now part of the core logic.

What's good about this:
* Low level instructions are easier to write an interpreter for

What's bad about this:
* It's easy to have too much detail in the pure code now
  It looks very like the imperative code

    // ------------------------------
    // using high level instructions
    // ------------------------------
    GetInput (anagram,fun input ->
        match input with

    // ------------------------------
    // using low level instructions
    // ------------------------------
    WriteLine ("\n== new round ==\n", fun () ->
    WriteLine (sprintf "The anagram is '%s'" anagram, fun () ->
    WriteLine ("Please enter your word, or <enter> to see the word, or '.' to quit", fun () ->
    ReadLine (fun input ->
