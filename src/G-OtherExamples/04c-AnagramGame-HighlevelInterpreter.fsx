// =================================
// Anagram game - High Level Interpreter implementation
// =================================


(*
This is the Interpreter implementation
* The "Pure.play" function returns a "program" with instructions for the shell I/O
* The top level shell interprets those instructions by reading or writing
  However it could be interpreted in another way, e.g. with a GUI
* In this implementation, the instructions are "high level"
  such as GetInput, RevealTarget, etc.
  The exact text to display is left as a low level detail for the interpreter

What's good about this:
* Very easy to change the interpreter
* High level instructions are easier to understand and better for testing

What's bad about this:
* The continuation passing can get annoying. So see the computation expression version
  for a variant that makes the code cleaner

    // using continations
    GetInput (anagram,fun input ->
        match input with

    // using a CE
    let! input = getInput anagram
    match input with

*)
