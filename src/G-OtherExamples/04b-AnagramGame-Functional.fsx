// =================================
// Anagram game - Functional implementation
// =================================

(*
How the game works:

In each round of the game, the player is presented with an
anagram of a six-letter word where that anagram is not itself
a word (so ANTLER might be presented as AELNRT but not LEARNT).

The user can enter an answer, or hit return to see the answer,
or enter a full stop to quit the game completely.
If there is more than one solution to an anagram,
all of them are valid (so ANTLER, LEARNT and RENTAL would all be correct
answers to AELNRT)

At the end of each round, the user is shown the number of rounds
attempted and the number of anagrams solved.
*)


(*
------------------------------------------
Implementation details:
------------------------------------------

For each round:
1. Pick a word (the TARGET) from the wordlist and
   make an anagram of it such that the anagram is not also a valid word
2. Print the anagram and instructions
   "Please enter your guess, or <enter> to see the word, or '.' to quit"
3. Accept input from user
4a. If the input is "." then quit
        show "Game over. Thanks for playing"
        show the game state
        quit
4b. If the input is CR then show the answer
        show the TARGET
        update the game state: increment number of rounds
        show the game state
        and go to step 1
4c. If the input is an anagram of the displayed word AND is a valid word
        show "Solved!"
        update the game state: increment number of rounds, increment number of anagrams solved.
        show the game state
        and go to step 1
4d. If the input is NOT an anagram of the displayed word OR is not a valid word
        show "Failed!"
        update the game state: increment number of rounds
        show the game state
        and go to step 1
4. Quit (from 3a)
    show the game state
    exit

// =====================================
// This is the functional implementation
// * IO is separated from pure code
// * The "Pure.play" function handles a "request" and
//   returns a "response" with instructions for the shell I/O
// * The top level shell interprets the response by reading or writing
//   and then sending another request to the pure code.
