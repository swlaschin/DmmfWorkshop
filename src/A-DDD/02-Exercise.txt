// =================================
// Exercise 2: Convert your domain model into F# code
// =================================

Read through and understand the TicTacToe example:
* 02a-DomainModel-TicTacToe.fsx
  compare it with the original at 01a-DomainModel-TicTacToe.txt

Convert your domain into code using this file:
* 02b-DomainModel-YourOwnDomain.fsx
  (It has a help section with all the F# you need to know for this exercise)
* Compare your code with other people in your group

If you want to do another domain as well, use
* 02c-DomainModel-YourOwnDomain2.fsx
