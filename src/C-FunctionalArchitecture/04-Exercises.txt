// Exercise 4:
// =================================

This demonstrates how an imperative implemention (with IO mixed in with logic)
can be converted to a impure/pure/impure sandwich

Read through and understand all the code
* 04a-AnagramGame-Imperative.fsx
* 04b-AnagramGame-Functional.fsx

Another approach is to use an interpreter which creates 
a data structure consisting of a list of instructions
* 04c-AnagramGame-HighLevelInterpreter.fsx

A computation expression can be used to make the code cleaner
* 04d-AnagramGame-HighLevelInterpreterCE.fsx

The instructions in the interpreter can also be very low level
* 04e-AnagramGame-LowLevelInterpreter.fsx
* 04f-AnagramGame-LowLevelInterpreterCE.fsx
